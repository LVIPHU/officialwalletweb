## Overview

Multi-signature (multi-sig) technology adds an extra layer of security to your TBC Wallet by requiring multiple approvals before any transaction can be executed. This feature is essential for protecting high-value assets and is ideal for both personal use and shared wallets.

## What is Multi-Signature?

Multi-signature is a security feature that requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. Instead of a single key controlling your wallet, multi-sig wallets require a predetermined number of signatures (e.g., 2 out of 3, 3 out of 5) to approve any transaction.

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: Configure your multi-sig wallet with multiple key holders
2. **Transaction Request**: When a transaction is initiated, it requires approval
3. **Approval Process**: Designated signers must approve the transaction
4. **Execution**: Once the required number of approvals is reached, the transaction executes

## Security Benefits

### Protection Against Single Point of Failure

- **Key Loss**: If one key is lost, your funds remain secure
- **Theft Prevention**: A single compromised key cannot drain your wallet
- **Internal Threats**: Reduces risk from malicious insiders

### Enhanced Control

- **Shared Wallets**: Perfect for businesses or families managing shared funds
- **Governance**: Enables democratic decision-making for fund management
- **Audit Trail**: All approvals are recorded for transparency

### Regulatory Compliance

- **Corporate Use**: Meets requirements for corporate treasury management
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements for fund custody
- **Accountability**: Clear approval chain for financial audits

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many signatures do I need?

The number of required signatures depends on your configuration. Common setups are 2-of-3 or 3-of-5, but you can customize based on your needs.

### What happens if I lose a key?

If you lose a key but still have enough keys to meet the threshold, you can continue operating normally. However, you should replace the lost key to maintain redundancy.

### Can I change the multi-sig configuration?

Yes, you can modify your multi-sig configuration, but this typically requires approval from existing key holders to ensure security.

### Is multi-sig slower than regular transactions?

Multi-sig transactions may take slightly longer as they require multiple approvals, but the enhanced security is worth the minimal delay.

### Can I use multi-sig with hardware wallets?

Yes, TBC Wallet supports hardware wallet integration for multi-signature setups, providing even greater security.
