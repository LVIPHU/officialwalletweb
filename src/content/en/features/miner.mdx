## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is PoS staking safe with TB Wallet?

Yes, staking through TB Wallet is secure. All transactions are encrypted, and your private keys remain on your device. However, staking carries inherent risks including validator slashing and network risks.

### How often are rewards distributed?

Reward distribution depends on the network and validator. Most PoS networks distribute rewards continuously as blocks are validated, with withdrawal available at any time.

### Can I stake with multiple validators?

Yes, you can stake with multiple validators simultaneously to diversify your risk and potentially increase rewards.

### What is the minimum staking amount?

Minimum staking amounts vary by network and validator. Check individual validator requirements before staking.

### How do I withdraw my staking rewards?

Rewards can be withdrawn at any time through the Withdrawal section. Staked tokens may require an unbonding period before withdrawal.

### What happens if a validator is slashed?

If a validator you've staked with is slashed, you may lose a portion of your staked tokens proportional to the slash amount. Always research validators before staking.

### Can I change validators after staking?

Yes, you can unstake from one validator and stake with another. Be aware of any unbonding periods that may apply.
